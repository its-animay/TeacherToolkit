Please finalize the Create AI Teacher flow with the following fixes and integrations:

✅ 1. Fix API Call Placement in Multi-Step Flow
The current Create AI Teacher API is being called at Step 2 (Personality) — this is incorrect.

Move the API call to the final step (Step 3: Specialization) so that:

All data from Step 1 (Basic Info), Step 2 (Personality), and Step 3 (Specialization) is merged

Then submitted as a single POST request to create the AI teacher

✅ 2. Link Created AI Teacher to Instructor
When a user clicks “Create AI Teacher” on an Instructor card:

Redirect to /create-ai-teacher/:instructorId

Prefill the multi-step form using instructor data (name, avatar, bio, etc.)

On final submit, include instructorId in the request payload

✅ 3. Fetch Created AI Teacher and Update CTA
After successful creation:

Call the following API to retrieve the created AI teacher:

http
Copy
Edit
GET /api/v1/enhanced-teacher/{teacher_id}
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Show the teacher data linked to the instructor

Update the CTA on the Instructor card from:

css
Copy
Edit
[ Create AI Teacher ]
to:

css
Copy
Edit
[ View AI Teacher ]
This button should open the AI teacher profile view or edit screen.

✅ 4. Validation Rules to Enforce
In Step 2 (Personality):
primary_traits: max 3 traits can be selected

Add frontend validation with message: You can select up to 3 primary traits

teaching_style, formality_level, humor_usage, etc. — all required

Add required field warnings to all fields in this step

In Step 3 (Specialization):
specializations: required

primary_domain: required

min_difficulty ≤ max_difficulty

At least one capability checkbox (can_create_exercises, can_grade_work, etc.) should be selected

In Step 1:
name, avatar_url, and system_prompt_template must not be empty

✅ 5. Show Linked AI Teacher with Instructor
When loading Instructor Management:

Check if each instructor has an associated AI teacher

If yes, change the CTA to View AI Teacher

Optionally show AI teacher metadata like:

Created at

Total sessions

Rating

Clicking View AI Teacher opens a detailed profile view using the enhanced teacher API data
